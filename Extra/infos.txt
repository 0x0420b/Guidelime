I am making my own guide where I only kept the essential text and made it as clear and concise and visually appealing as possible. So far I used a different speedleveler's route for 1-20 & Joana's route for 20-40 (He hasn't released 40-60 yet for alliance).
My guide isn't really meant to be public but I think it could give you an idea of what you could turn Joana's guide into & how the steps might look.

Hello! I am writing a speedleveling guide and was wondering if it would be possible for users to input their own guides?
